# Vibe Coding Course Dashboard

## Overview

This is a front-end web application for a coding course dashboard that guides users through their web development learning journey. The application is built as a static website using HTML, CSS (with Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript, featuring a dual-theme system with a magical Harry Potter-inspired dark mode and a clean light mode. It includes floating mystical elements, animated effects, an interactive checklist system with achievement badges, and a theme toggle with localStorage persistence.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Static Website**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript implementation without backend dependencies
- **Mobile-First Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile devices (90% of users), with progressive enhancement for tablets and desktop
- **Component-based Structure**: Modular JavaScript for checklist functionality
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript, enhanced with interactive features
- **Touch-Optimized**: Enhanced touch interactions with proper touch targets and feedback

### Styling Strategy
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework loaded via CDN for rapid development
- **Custom CSS**: Additional styling in `styles.css` for magical animations and specialized effects
- **Magical Color Palette**: Harry Potter-inspired color scheme with gold, burgundy, emerald, and mystical purple accents
- **Typography**: Inter font for general text, JetBrains Mono for code elements
- **Magical Effects**: Floating elements, sparkle animations, gradient text, and mystical glow effects

## Key Components

### 1. Interactive Checklist System

1. GitHub account creation
2. GitHub-Replit integration
3. GitHub Pages deployment
4. Domain connection with DNS setup
5. Celebration milestone

## Data Flow

1. **Initial Load**: Application loads static HTML structure
2. **JavaScript Enhancement**: Checklist data populates from JavaScript array
3. **User Interaction**: Click events toggle completion status
4. **Persistence**: Local storage maintains state between sessions
5. **External Navigation**: Affiliate links redirect to external resources

## External Dependencies

### CDN Resources
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling framework (cdn.tailwindcss.com)
- **Google Fonts**: Inter and JetBrains Mono fonts
- **No JavaScript Libraries**: Vanilla JavaScript implementation

### Affiliate Partners
- **GitHub**: Version control and repository hosting
